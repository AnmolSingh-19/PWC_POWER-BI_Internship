# PWC Power BI Virtual Internship

» During this program, I performed various tasks that helped me learn essential skills required for data analysis and data visualization using Power BI in a meaningful manner.

## TASK 1 : Call Centre Analysis

► As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created a "Call Center Analysis" Dashboard, using Power BI. This dataset containing call records from a customer service center. Each row represents a call with various attributes such as Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, whether it was Answered (Yes/No), Resolved, Speed of answer in seconds, and Average Talk Duration.

### Objective:
» The objective of the dashboard is to deliver meaningful insights and actionable information to empower the Call Centre.
